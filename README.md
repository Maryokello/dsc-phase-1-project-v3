# Phase 1 Project Description

You've made it all the way through the first phase of this course - take a minute to celebrate your awesomeness!

Now you will put your new skills to use with a large end-of-Phase project!


## Project Overview

Our company is diversifying into aviation, with the goal of identifying the lowest-risk aircraft to purchase by analyzing aviation accident records from 1962 to 2023, sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

### Business Problem

Our company is branching out into new industries as part of our diversification strategy. One area we're exploring is the purchase and operation of aircraft for both commercial and private use. However, we currently have limited understanding of the potential risks associated with different aircraft models. I’ve been assigned to identify the lowest-risk aircraft options to support this new venture. My role is to analyze the data and provide clear, actionable recommendations to guide the aviation division in making informed purchasing decisions.

### The Data

In the data folder, we have access to a dataset from the National Transportation Safety Board that contains aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023. It includes records of civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
The dataset contains records of over 90,000 aviation accidents, with key features including Aircraft Type, Weather, Phase of Flight, Injury Severity, and Flight Purpose. I cleaned the missing data using both dropna() and imputation methods. Additionally, I renamed, transformed, and standardized the columns to improve clarity and consistency in analysis.




Key questions:
1. Which aircraft models have the lowest accident rates?
2. What factors contribute most to severe accidents?
3. Are there specific conditions that lead to more accidents?

Findings

• Aircraft types with fewest accidents were identified.
• Visualizations explored severity, conditions, and trends.
• Severe accidents are often linked with:
   - Bad weather
   - Personal/instructional flights
   - Substantial damage
• Trend: Decrease in accidents over time.



### Interactive Dashboard

The interactive dashboard is a collection of views that allows the viewer to change the views to understand different features in the data. This dashboard will be linked within your GitHub repository README.md file so that users can explore your analysis. Make sure you follow visual best practices that you have learned in this course. Below is an example of what you could produce for this assignment.

Recommendations
• Invest in aircraft types with a strong safety record.
• E.g., Aircraft Type CESSNA 150M showed the lowest rate of incidents.
• Avoid risky flying conditions.
 Poor weather increases the likelihood of severe accidents.
• Focus on commercial/business aircraft.
• Personal/instructional flights are riskier.
